# ASD-Collaboration
Welcome to our ASD collaboration page for our VR group. 

All disabilities come with social stigma and presumptions of incompetence. Autism Spectrum Disorders comes with a particularly unusual set of assumptions that leave the individual isolated. All mandated services individuals receive in high school disappear with graduation.  Even the individuals that are able to pursue a higher education are not better off in a job search. As of 2018, there is an 85% of unemployment among college-educated individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A core of the disability is an inability to relate easily to other people, yet the majority of people on the spectrum do have some amount of social appetite. 

This project was developed to help build communication skills as a form of collaboration for an individual on the Spectrum. Neurotypical peers gain important mastery in the areas of social, communication, and basic living skills simply by implicit learning. For people with autism, explicit instruction may be needed to complete a more abstract skill set. 

The job interview process is so focused on socialization and communication skills, which puts many adults with autism at a disadvantage. Even practicing for the interview is not a long term solution to help maintain a job long term. Communication and collaboration are essential to a cohesive workplace. Language is thought to be important because it allows any person to participate fully in the culture, to engage in social communication, and to join in on the conversation. Communicative acts are imperative for behavior regulation (requests and refusals) and a large portion of interpersonal relations (social interaction and joint attention). 

Creating a scene where there is a discrete task of building a piece of furniture provides a developmentally appropriate motivating way to practice and have opportunities for social communication. Questioning for help and progress reports are indicative of any employer and employee relationship. Outlined for the assessor is a prompting guideline to elicit a response and more communication acts the individual may be capable of. Any communicative act is coded and accredited to the individual as participation in the experience. Asking for a break and to be removed is preferred end as compared to silently putting together the furniture. Having a scored assessment like this can expose areas of weakness and strengths for the individual to practice in order to go into the workplace. Having high communicative levels simulated in virtual reality can be put on a resume as proof for employment. There is a great functionality component individuals on the spectrum beyond what they are usually prescribed to.
